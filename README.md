# 🌀 Dynamic Resume — A Living, Breathing Creative Expression

This isn't just a resume — it's a **dynamic, adaptive, and evolving expression of who I am**, built with intention, code, and creativity. It's designed to respond to context, connect with its viewer, and highlight what's most relevant — without losing its soul.

## 🎨 What Makes This Resume Different?

- **🧠 Intelligent Adaptation**  
  Tailors itself to you — the visitor — by interpreting where you're coming from (literally and figuratively). Recruiter? Engineer? Director? You’ll see what matters to you.

- **💡 One Source, Infinite Stories**  
  Every version is generated from a single original resume. But each rendering tells a slightly different story — contextual, curated, and purposeful.

- **🌐 A Resume That Reacts**  
  No more static PDFs. This resume evolves — with new projects, updated experience, or fresh design — all in real time.

- **🛠️ Engineered for Expression**  
  Built using modern web technologies not just for functionality, but as an extension of my voice and craft.
